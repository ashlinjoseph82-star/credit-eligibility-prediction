Credit Completion & Degree Eligibility Prediction System

This project predicts degree eligibility and graduation risk for university students based on category-wise credit completion under a credit-based academic structure.

The system is designed as an academic decision-support tool that reflects how universities evaluate student progress. It focuses on identifying potential graduation risks early, without penalizing students for credits that are not yet available according to academic timelines.

Project Objectives

Assess whether a student is currently on track for graduation

Identify graduation risk levels (Low, Medium, High)

Provide early warnings based on academic credit patterns

Support students and administrators with data-driven insights

System Overview

The project follows a production-style machine learning workflow, including:

Synthetic academic data generation

SQL-based data storage

Training and evaluation of traditional machine learning models

Model comparison and selection

Prediction-ready inference pipeline

Interactive Streamlit dashboard for analysis and predictions

Version-controlled development lifecycle

Machine Learning Models

The following models were trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression – baseline model with interpretability

Decision Tree – captures non-linear academic patterns

Random Forest – selected as the final deployed model

The Random Forest classifier was chosen due to its stronger performance across accuracy, precision, and recall, as well as its robustness and generalization ability.

Dashboard Features

The interactive dashboard allows users to:

View academic credit summaries

Compare model performance metrics

Explore data through visual analysis

Generate graduation eligibility predictions

Understand graduation risk levels at different academic stages

Technology Stack

Python

Streamlit

Pandas and NumPy

Disclaimer

Predictions generated by this system are advisory in nature and are intended to support, not replace, official academic evaluations. The tool functions as an early-warning mechanism to help identify potential graduation risks in advance.
